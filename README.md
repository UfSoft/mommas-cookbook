### What is the origin of bacalhau à Gomes de Sá?

José Luís Gomes de Sá, was born in Porto, on 7 February 1851. Gomes de Sá was the son of a rich
19th century cod trader in Porto. The family fortune dwindled as there was a devastating fire in
the warehouse.

José then had to find a job at Restaurante Lisbonense, a restaurant in downtown Porto where he
created this recipe.

Gomes de Sá was not only a cod trader but also a food connoisseur. He used a well-known recipe for
bolinhos de bacalhau or cod fish cakes and with the same ingredients (minus the flour) decided to
create a new recipe. Bacalhau à Gomes de Sá was born.

He sold the recipe to the owner of Restaurante Lisbonense for 50,000 reis at the time. The
manuscript of the recipe attributed to Gomes de Sá has a famous note at the end : “João, se
alterares qualquer coisa já não fica capaz” which can be translated to “João, if you change
anything, you won’t succeed”.

A century later, this Portuguese bacalhau recipe has won multiple culinary prizes and was one of
the 21 finalists in the competition to name the 7 gastronomic wonders of Portugal.

#### Bacalhau recipes in Portugal

Bacalhau recipes are very common in Portugal, but also in Galicia (Northwest of Spain) and in
former Portuguese colonies including Cape Verde, Angola, Macau, Brazil and Goa.

It is said that there are hundreds of bacalhau recipes in Portugal. Bacalhau is cod fish, but in
the context of Portuguese cuisine, it is really dried and salted cod.

Fresh cod (unsalted) is called bacalhau fresco. What is intriguing is even though Portuguese eat a
lot of cod, it is probably the only fish that is not eaten fresh in Portugal!

Salted cod has been produced for more than 500 years. It was the best way to preserve food before
the advent of refrigeration.

The Portuguese had tried to use this method of drying and salting fish with numerous fish that they
could find in their waters, but they eventually found the ideal fish in Newfoundland, long after
the Basque arrived.
